# Part 1 - the causal salad

There are a few reasons for performing regression modelling, as listed
in [Regression and Other
Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/) (ROS) by Gelman et
al.Â 

-   Predicting or forecasting outcomes using existing data (does not aim
    to understand causality).  
-   Exploring associations between variables of interest and an
    outcome.  
-   Adjusting outcomes from a sample to infer something about a
    population of interest.  
-   Estimating treatment effects by comparing outcomes between a
    treatment and control (defined in ROS as causal inference).

McElreath emphasises that what scientific practitioners are often
looking for is a method to **separate spurious associations from true
causal relationships**. McElreath is critical of those who carelessly
use regression modelling to identify causal relationships.

**Scenario:**

We are interested in whether the family size of the mother has any
impact on the family size of the daughter.

-   We have data on the family sizes of mother and daughter pairs.  
-   We expect unmeasured confounds (shared environmental exposures) for
    mother and daughter pairs.  
-   Previous research indicates that birth order is associated with
    fertility, which impacts family size.

``` r
# Create a synthetic data model ------------------------------------------------
set.seed(111)

N <- 200 # Number of mother-daughter pairs
U <- rnorm(N) # Simulate confounds

U[1:5]
#> [1] -0.3832159 -0.6019343  0.8216938 -0.4526242  0.3254342

# B1 represents the mother's birth order where 1 indicates 'is first born'
B1 <- rbinom(N, size = 1, prob = 0.5) # Probability 50% are first born
B1[1:5]
#> [1] 0 1 0 0 0

# M represents the mother's family size
# In our model, the mother's family size is directly influenced by B1 and U
M <- rnorm(N, mean = 2*B1 + U) 
M[1:5]
#> [1]  0.37835160  0.03283694 -0.51075527 -4.15239295  1.66977563

M <- ifelse(M < 0, 0, round(M, digits = 0))
M[1:5]
#> [1] 0 0 0 0 2

# B2 represents the daughter's birth order where 1 indicates 'is first born' 
# B2 occurs independently of B1 
B2 <- rbinom(N, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
B2[1:5]
#> [1] 1 1 0 0 1 

# D represents the daughter's family size 
# We first assume that the mother's family size has no impact on the daughter's 
# family size.  
D <- rnorm(N, 2*B2 + U + 0*M) 
D[1:5]
#> [1]  0.4896820  2.4589650  0.5504082 -2.3242933  2.9083178  

D <- ifelse(D < 0, 0, round(D, digits = 0))
D[1:5]
#> [1] 0 2 1 0 3
```
